 * Convex-backed media-upload helper — the Phase 6 replacement for this
 * module's Supabase Storage version (account-scoped bucket paths, RLS
 * write policies). Convex's storage model needs no bucket/path
 * convention of its own: every stored file gets an opaque
 * `Id<"_storage">`, minted via `api.files.generateUploadUrl`, its
 * ownership recorded via `api.files.registerUpload`, and resolved to a
 * fetchable URL via `api.files.getUrl` — see `convex/files.ts`'s header
 * comment.
 *
 * Both functions below are plain (non-hook) functions — they run inside
 * event handlers / callbacks, not render bodies, so they can't call
 * `useConvex()`/`useMutation()` themselves. Callers thread in the Convex
 * handles they already hold from their OWN hooks instead: a
 * `ConvexReactClient` (from `useConvex()`) for the `registerUpload`/
 * `getUrl`/`remove` calls, plus the `generateUploadUrl` mutation fn (from
 * `useMutation(api.files.generateUploadUrl)`) for minting the upload
 * URL. This mirrors `src/components/settings/profile-form.tsx`'s
 * avatar-upload flow exactly (see its `onSubmit`, ~L115-140).
